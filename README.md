# Omarchy customization

## HYPRLAND
### Installation of `split-monitor-workspace` hyprland module
`split-monitor-workspace` allows for better navigation of workspaces when running hyprland on multiple monitors.

```bash
hyprpm add https://github.com/Duckonaut/split-monitor-workspaces # Add the plugin repository
hyprpm enable split-monitor-workspaces # Enable the plugin
hyprpm reload # Reload the plugins
```

## Scripts
### `launch-webapp-chromium`
Quick and dirty hack to allow launching webapp in chromium instead of the default browser. Useful for webapps which do not properly work with the default broser (e.g. overly strict configuration in Brave).

## Waybar
### VPN selection scripts
Scripts prepared to handle selecting, connecting and disconnecting from a wireguard based VPN. By no means good scripts and should probably be exchanged for something better...
